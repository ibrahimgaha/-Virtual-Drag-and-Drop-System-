# Virtual Drag-and-Drop System

This project is a **Virtual Drag-and-Drop System** that uses computer vision techniques with **OpenCV** and **Python**. The system allows users to interact with on-screen objects (like rectangles) by tracking hand movements. This simulates the behavior of a cursor, where the hand can "hold" onto a virtual object and drag it across the screen.

## Features
- Real-time hand tracking using OpenCV.
- Simulates mouse cursor behavior for selecting and dragging objects.
- Customizable interaction zones and objects.
- Efficient tracking and gesture recognition.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The main programming language used for developing the project.
- **OpenCV**: For computer vision tasks, especially for detecting hand gestures and tracking movements.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

1. **Python 3.x**: Download and install from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. **OpenCV**: Install via pip using:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
